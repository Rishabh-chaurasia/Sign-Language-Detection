# Sign-Language-Detection
ü§ü Sign Language Detection: A machine learning project detecting and interpreting sign language gestures for improved accessibility.


Project Deployment
 1. Data Collection (datacollection.py):
 ÔÅ¨ RunthePython script datacollection.py to initiate data collection.
 ÔÅ¨ Capture approximately 500 images of hand gestures using a webcam or a camera
 connected to the system.
 ÔÅ¨ Savetheimages in a structured directory format for easy access and organization.
 2. Data Preparation:
 ÔÅ¨ Preprocess the collected images to ensure uniformity and compatibility with the training
 process.
 ÔÅ¨ Resizeimages to a consistent resolution.
 ÔÅ¨ Normalize pixel values to a common scale.
 ÔÅ¨ Augmentthe dataset if necessary to increase variability and improve model generalization.
 3. Model Training (Google Teachable):
 ÔÅ¨ Uploadthe preprocessed dataset to a platform like Google Teachable Machine for training.
 ÔÅ¨ Define the categories or labels corresponding to each hand gesture phrase:
 1. Hello
 2: No
 3: Okay
 4: Please
 5: Thank you
 6: Yes
 ÔÅ¨ Configure the training parameters, including the number of epochs (e.g., 350) and batch
 size.
 ÔÅ¨ Initiate model training and monitor the training process for convergence and performance.
 4. Model Evaluation:
 ÔÅ¨ Evaluate the trained model's performance using validation metrics such as accuracy,
 precision, recall, and F1 score.
 ÔÅ¨ Validate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data and accurately classify hand
 gestures.

5. Export Model (Keras File):
 ÔÅ¨ Oncetraining is complete, download the trained model in Keras format (.h5 file).
 ÔÅ¨ Savethedownloaded model file to the local filesystem for later use.
 6. Model Deployment:
 ÔÅ¨ Usethedownloaded Keras model file (model.h5) to deploy the sign language detection
 system.
 ÔÅ¨ Develop aPython script or application to load the model and perform real-time inference
 on input images or video streams.
 ÔÅ¨ Integrate the model with the user interface for seamless interaction and feedback.
 7. System Execution:
 ÔÅ¨ RunthePython script or application to execute the sign language detection system.
 ÔÅ¨ Utilize webcam or camera input to capture live hand gestures.
 ÔÅ¨ Process the input images using the deployed model to recognize and classify hand gestures
 into corresponding phrases.
 ÔÅ¨ Display the detected phrases or perform further actions based on the recognized gestures.
